# Abstraction
Abstraction is just adding a layer of ambiguity that simplifies any resulting experience. 

## Real world abstraction: dining
When you eat out, the restaurant provides the abstraction layers allowing you to eat without handling the work to prepare the food. 

The waiter is the abstraction layer that converts your order into a prepared meal. 

That is the only layer that a customer typically interacts with. Every abstraction layer nested further presents almost infinite choice for the restaurant to improve the overall dining experience.

The chef is the layer that plans ingredients and actually cooks the food. The restaurant can choose whether diners would prefer to see the chef, possibly to showcase their skill and prowess, or whether to hide the kitchen, allowing a facade to hide any unbecoming machinery in the kitchen.


## Computers are just abstraction machines
The first job for a computer was to abstract thinking away from people. Everything we have done with them since is in an effort to reduce how much effort we input to achieve any given task.

Digital abstraction is most refined within computer science. There might be a silent hope that any heavily nested abstractions propagate out to benefit all computer users.

Abstraction is quite abstract, so it's not always obvious when an abstraction layer is presented. If someone created a generic abstraction layer but only presented a domain specific use case, someone else would need to "translate" how it can be used elsewhere.


## Gen AI and MCPs
Gen AI is a hot topic that enables software development for everyone. Computer science becomes an optional abstraction layer.

MCPs have been presented as an abstraction layer between multiple Gen AI agents. This is an oversimplification of the opportunities presented by MCPs. But why?

RAG has been presented as the abstraction layer between Gen AI agents and data. RAG is actually a data collection method. RAG tools can provide data directly, but typically sit behind an MCP. What gives?

We can already see MCPs are an abstraction layer between `Gen AI agents` and either `Gen AI agents` or `data`. The reality is trickle feeding opportunity in an effort to limit adoption and opportunity.


## Real talk on MCPs
MCPs can easily be reduced to these specific topics because it is such a general abstraction layer that it can be hard to put the entire scope into words. 

Everything we do with computers can be reduced to data and communication, and MCPs handle both. MCPs are providing a generic transport layer for "anything".

The hard part is re-expanding how this new data and communication format slots in to replace other existing abstraction layers. Or, even, identifying which abstraction layers are suitable for replacement. 

Most people aren't aware of the already-many layers required to display a web page. That is one of the simpler operations that is destined for replacement. 

So applying the same improvement across the entire digital ecosystem - to all content consumed and for all output produced? That's an immeasurably long pole to handle. 


## Idle risks
The risk in just "waiting for someone else to handle it" is that the massive power afforded by it is altering power scales magnitudes at a time. 

If someone is capable of creating MCP, they are capable of explaining the potential in full. But they didn't. 

The longer "we" wait to apply these benefits elsewhere the more power accumulates towards a few single "points", and the more quickly it continues accumulating at those points. 

Is that by design? The same entities accumulating power are the same ones that helped fund its development, so you tell me.
