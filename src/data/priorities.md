# Data Priorities
Data can be prioritized based on the target's capability and the consumption time. 

The most efficient target will enable use of the most efficient data possible. 

## Efficiency measures
Efficiency is a measure of length, speed and continuity. This could also be stated as a measure of time and connectivity. 

### Data based
The desired input is whatever will enables the target to reach any required comprehension in the least time.

If the goal is to learn with no particular end-state understanding in mind, the desired input can be prioritized based on:
1. Breadth; and,
2. Depth.

That is: 
1. The local breadth of current material that the target should come to know; and,
2. The global breadth that the current material should readily fasten to; and
3. The local depth of required or desired understanding; and
4. Whether the global depth should maintained, extended, or (in rare cases) reduced.


### Target based
The local and global breadth and depth required are based on the target's ability to comprehend and connect data. An ability to parse local data does not imply immediately available connections with any already known global data. 

The input may or may not align with other data the target knows or will come to know. Any lacking continuity requires additional self-enabled connectivity by the target. This means the data's connectedness and lack thereof will impose requirements on the target's ability to form connections between seemingly unrelated data, either by producing the missing pieces from understanding alone or by identifying what additional input is required to sufficiently fill any gaps.

Whether or not local and global data will connect partly depend on whether the target knows a connection should exist. Some languages follow rules like "explicit is better than implicit", so targets may dispose of implied connections unless reinforced by an external validator.

In the case of a bad acting or poorly trained external validator, the barriers to building implied connections will rise. Validators can be assigned "trustoworthiness" ratings, so that low-trust, highly-available validators can be used early on without impeding expedited correction from high-trust low-availability validators later.
