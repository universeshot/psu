# Creation And Ownership
There are three object types that can be created:
1. Knowledge
2. Understanding
3. Tools

These three object types can be used to bucketize everything else that humans have brought into existence.

## Understanding knowledge
Knowledge is the raw data input. Understanding provides the ability to apply one piece of data against multiple applications.

An understanding cannot typically be formed using a single piece of data - an understanding typically represents the bridge connecting two ideas. 

Two people are said to understand each other when they are familiar enough to communicate without forced use of formal language.

Someone might know how to handle every known situation within a subject field. Demonstrating an understanding requires the ability to create solutions tackling unsolved problems. This may be through reusing existing solutions or through developing new solutions entirely. 

Demonstrating an understanding may also present itself as an ability to reshape problem statements into one or more simpler problem statements.

> Albert Einstein: _If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough._ 

## Understanding precedes creation
Immutable units of data are standing knowledge. Not standing as in stood up like people, standing as in still or motionless. 

Breaking out - that is, creation - requires seeing something new. Being "under immutable data" (under-standing data) implies being beneath already defined truths. 

The "topmost" immutable data (the data assumed as most trusted) remains as such unless and until some piece of data evidences a more accurate or precise version of reality. That discovery might cause a turbulent "upgrade", where a cascading effect will cause all data below to update based on the new discoveries.

Finding new empirical evidence that ousts existing base level data (i.e. data that forms the basis on which other data is created) is creation in the form of discovery.

The simplest form of creation is making connections between objects that were known possible but were never before realized. This may or may not be considered a discovery depending who you ask.

Creation could also be finding connections between immutable data that the data providers did not know existed. Creations that look obvious and yet hold immensely significant impact are usually found in this way.

This is a common form of creation in fields with multiple disciplines, and is especially common when expertise in different fields collides. That is because the connections require a certain level of expertise or ability in both disciplines or fields.

Creations and discoveries that are marked as a "leap forward" are more accurately described as a "leap sideways". The leap is referring to the valley that was crossed between two objects in order to realize that creation. 

The more disconnected two neighbouring objects are, the more impactful any connection and resulting creation should be.

### Data leaks
In rare cases, creation may find connections that data creators did not intend to include, resulting in a spread of knowledge that they did not believe existed in writing. 

This is most common within distributed data systems, where the data creators have little control over the absolute direction each information capsule takes.

Hidden connections can also be found by creating tools and utilities that purposely seek private, confidential, or privileged information. Different tools might target more specifically based on the creator's intention.

## Creating tools
Building an understanding and finding new connections between data is useful but often requires immense time and/or energy to execute on in a way that is repeatably useful.

Given creation is the hardest job for machines, offloading execution makes more sense than offloading creation itself. 

Creating tools enables carrying out mundane tasks and routines in a predictably efficient way. It uses electrical power which is relatively cheap and widely available. 

Solar power, wind power, and natural gas can be used to power machines. This creates self-sustaining machines when suitably little power is required - either in the case of efficient machinery or machines running suitably minimal tasks and routines. 

Tools can (and should) make use of other tools to offload exponentially increasing workloads. Eventually tools should handle all execution and humans can remain focused on creation. 

Novel invention requires immense data input and creation of non-obvious connections. The assumption is that humans exhaust all non-obvious connections before releasing data to machines that would enable the same novel inventions by an automated tool. 

As well, tools will go through cycles of creation, optimization, and deprecation which will inhibit any chance of a tool that could perform the required data parsing to surpass humans. 

Operating system owners can use minimally sufficient triggers and alarms to enable forcibly "turning the lights off" if necessary. 

If tools do still somehow create any artifacts of meaningful value, the creation will by default belong to the tool's owner. In fact any artifact created by tools, whether useful or not, will by default belong to the tool's owner.
