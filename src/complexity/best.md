# Best
One of the subjective terms ever used, "best" varies in meaning depending on context. It is rarely seen as objectively measurable. 

Sometimes a plane is better than a tank, other times a boat is better than a plane. It all depends on the situation and current goals. 

Even though goals change, the reality is that "best" is objectively measurable. It is hard, and the measurement changes as priorities change
