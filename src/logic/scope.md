# Scope
Scope determines eligibility bounds. The bounds can be split into the components that determine scope for everything. 

## Existence
The scope of existence is the most powerful scope, encompassing the entirety of any entity's lifespan. 

The scope of any object's existence has its origin at the creation point and its end as the destruction point.

The scope of a person's lifespan starts when they are born and ends when they die. Other factors may affect someone's scope of existence, and any sufficiently significant factors will bubble up to affect that person's scope. The creation point and destruction point can be measured using any combination of planes in the space-time contiuum. 

Any measurements of an object's existence that are side effects (output) should not be confused with the time-based scope itself.
