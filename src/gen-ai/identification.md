# Gen AI Identification
There are telling signs of real-time Gen AI production. Spotting them early can help avoid undue rabbit holes and surplus material requiring review.


## Why it matters
AI generators spread like wildfire. 

People are trying to mask interactions so as to not reveal AI production schemes. Interacting with an AI producer too frequently or for too long runs the risk of you picking up language and traits from those generators and talking with all the same features as an AI generator. 

Especially in a world where free thinking is flamed or otherwise discouraged, it is important to avoid the snake traps that would otherwise kill you in the plains.


## Consistency
AI production's most obvious tell is inconsistency when recounting the same high level idea multiple times. 

Any output lacking substance differing from what the user has provided as input is a sign of weak AI real-time generation. The indication is that the agent can understand the raw words and is attempting to feign understanding, but it shows the production cannot offer any material contributions. 

Changing the subject or diverting questions does not negate lacking consistency. If there is a logical connection or other meaningful reason to quickly raise something else, that warrants consideration as a human interaction.

If taking the conversational power away from you and presenting other items as immediately important becomes a consistent behaviour, that does typically imply you are interacting with an AI generator.


## Direction
Subject matter experts are usually capable of extended, uninterrupted discussion on any topic within the field of expertise. AI generators are not typically capable of the same uninterrupted discussion.

Questions during an AI production are acceptable, but if the demonstrated knowledge scope far exceeds the demonstrated scope of understanding then it is almost definitely an AI generator as opposed to another subject matter expert. 

Knowledge is demonstrated through ability to recall pieces of information. Understanding is demonstrated by an ability to tie new ideas in real time without being spoon fed. That includes tying contributor-provided ideas as well as providing its own ideas.

Understanding is also demonstrated by an ability to vary the depth on demand. A weak understanding is demonstrated by an ability to follow variations, where a strong understanding is demonstrated by actually ideating variations. Repeated use of the same variations does not demonstrate understanding.


## Tone
People tend to discuss using formal but polite tones. Equally, they will not be shocked by your use of formalities or pleasantries while interacting with them. If the suspect presents surprise at your use of basic manners (like "please" and "thank you") then it is likely a real-time AI production system.  

If the tone used has a tendency to shift rapidly from friendly to not, that is a strong indication of real-time generation. If the tone narrows towards your viewpoint on one topic but not all topics the interaction might be a real human interaction. If the tone narrows towards your viewpoint for _every_ topic then you are most definitely in a production scenario.
