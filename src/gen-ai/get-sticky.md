# Get Sticky
Being a "stick" is a question of how linear or exploratory something is. 

Straight line thinkers might be seen as lacking creativity. Being creative is a rewarding process for both the actors and observers. It adds an element of randomness that keeps things interesting. 

In programmed behaviour, however, randomness is problematic. Agentic interactions that yield variable success can be problematic when carrying out high velocity workflows. 


## Determinism (guaranteed behaviour)
Determinism (and deterministic behaviour) describes a guarantee that the same input will always yield the same output. 

Deterministic computer programs are well suited to run without any oversight. This enables continuous operations, and allows more aggressive efficiency improvements.

Any second pass over the same work implies additional computational power being wasted. A deterministic agent that yields predictably functional output will always prove more useful than an agent of equivalent ability that exhibits nondeterminism (nondeterministic behaviour).

## Completeness vs correctness
Standard (pre-Gen AI) computer programs were centered around the idea of completeness, and metrics focused around ensuring a task was complete correctly.
