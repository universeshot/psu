# Gen AI Risks
There are certain risks associated with the use of Gen AI, but they are not aligned with any of the risks discussed on the public stage.

People often discuss risks in terms of "threats Gen AI poses to humanity" but the reality is actually "threats to society through inequitable Gen AI implementation". 

## (Falsified) Threats to humanity
When purporting threats to humanity, public figures are putting forward an idea that executing current work with fully digitized agents will push the people to the point of dormancy and a state of perpetual decline. 

That threat is not a real threat. The only threat in that somewhat guaranteed eventuality is a threat to the continued wealth of those failing to provide societal value. 

The statement serves two purposes: 
1. Further any divide between technologists and laypersons; and
2. Discourage any technologists from surpassing laypersons in wealth and/or power.

The only way the people would reach a point of dormancy or perpetual decline is if continued development ceased and the economy started running as a circular but diminishing supply. 

### Identifying falsely presented threats
The only people with a vested interest in slowing or preventing further development are those already in control of any circular but diminishing supply of wealth (either money, opportunity, or both). 

If that were the case you might find unitized concentrations of wealth taking every opportunity to absorb anyone that shows promising ability to create opportunity in the future. This might present itself by corporations hiring idea-driving employees using inflated salaries, and then openly disparaging their workers through negative sentiment towards technology and over-publicized layoffs. The corporations may continue to acquire any startups using overestimated valuations, where thinkers escaped the first round up, only to curtail any truly innovative projects. The general sentiment would be an effort to trap "idea generators" within the company, or otherwise demoralize employees so they lose any drive to invent. 

## Threats to society
A threat to society would be implemented by gating access to functionality on per-user basis. 

This could extend to product-owning employees providing themselves an edge over other employees within the same company, subverting any power structures in place to ensure impartial treatment. This type of threat would be more likely at companies developing offerings alongside Gen AI. 

Anyone subverting power to gate Gen AI capabilities also has a vested interest in broadening the valley between "those with" and "those without". In preliminary systems those without full access are being used to generate the training data. As systems become more capable the gap that is the falsely gained competitive edge will grow, and any collapsing bridges might quickly reveal earlier malicious intentions.

We can see that certain companies have been planning for technology very strongly aligned with what has only just been released. For example, Apple's shortcuts are almost exactly aligned with how MCPs should integrate at an OS level, and they have been in production for many years already.

The greater likelihood is that multiple companies have been approaching this opportunity space from different angles. It's likely that one company will reach (or has reached) a point of superiority where they can far outperform the Gen AI capabilities from any other company. They may protect it using platform specific hardware, and then use that privatized technological advantage to enable their own corporate sieges. The capabilities, goals, and willingness to act in ill faith would likely exceed any equivalents already known by the companies being targeted internally. The only limitation is that the sieging company should have access and influence in a technically capable population that can readily backfill any open roles created by departing victims. 

If any companies were in such a position of superiority they would already have a long record profiteering from the capabilities that the rest of us are only seeing now. They may have no financial need to unleash their technical ability publicly, and would maintain focus on unrelated products so as to help inhibit any suspicion.
