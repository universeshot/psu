## Agentic experiences
Agentic experiences provide reliable execution of predefined tasks. Given any human input request, the agent will perform exactly the task requested. The agent will seek out additional information as necessary and will request manual intervention from the requester only if absolutely required.

These are more human equivalents of APTs ([Automatically Programmed Tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(programming_language))).
