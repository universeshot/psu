# Suite Gen AI Tasks
Simple libraries focused on completing individual tasks. Complex libraries and programs orchestrated sets of individual tasks into useful task series.

Gen AI takes many different task series and enables self-orchestration of entire productivity suites.

## Taking a step back
Moving back from complex, all-in-one programs to simple libraries may seem like a step backwards. In actuality, defining single tasks and enabling mass self-orchestration will become the norm. 

Similar to how there is no need to articulate every step of the day for a capable employee, there is no longer any need to spoon feed every step of a routine to a Gen AI agent.

Available composition components used to be limited based on how many a person could reasonably keep track of. Gen AI agents are capable of perusing near infinite optional components in order to ascertain the optimal viable inclusions.

## O(1, ish)
An ability to use of any number of components also presents the opportunity to explore more options. 

With a limited toolset the best choices are typically well defined. As any toolset expands, the de-facto best tool for each step becomes less certain. Tools providing optimal performance in niche circumstances will become more prevalent, as the per-tool implied manual testing burden is removed.

If the best performing tool chain has performance `O(1)`, then an agentic future will normalize towards `O(1, ish)`. This accounts for cases where alternates are tried but end up being time wasted (`O(just over 1)`) as well as cases where alternates are tested once and provide repeated performance gains (`O(less than 1)`).
