# Data Compression
Data Compression (DC) techniques are discussed in many domain-specific applications. DC takes "something big" and "makes it smaller". Compressed Data (CD) enables more efficient consumption. 

Any instance of DC requires a juxtaposed step enabling Data Decompression (DD). DC executions create CD that then requires DD to be "standard form" again. 

## Words are CD
A dictionary contains definitions to handle the DD step. In case of anyone unknown words, we review the DD manual to review, and optionally retain, what the word is shortform for.
